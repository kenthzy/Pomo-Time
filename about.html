                <h1>What is Pomodoro Time?</h1>
                    <p>
                        The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. 
                        The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, 
                        separated by short breaks. 
                        
                        Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped 
                        kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Wikipedia</a>
